# Reservation System
## Train Ticket Reservation System

The idea behind this project is to display train shedule or to reserve train tickets to various locations. The user must provide their credentials to log in to the SQL server before the program may run. Then decide between viewing every train that is running, viewing the train schedule, or making a reservation. 

"Python" programming language is used throughout this entire project. Users find it easy to use and understand.

## Features

- Log in to the SQL Server using your credentials.
- Check out the available trains.
- View train arrival times.
- Reservations for tickets are simple.
- Systematic presentation of train and reservation information
